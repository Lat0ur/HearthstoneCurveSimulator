# HearthstoneCurveSimulator

> Mana curve simulation and modeling for Hearthstone

## Description

This program allows a user to define the mana curve of their Hearthstone Deck and run a simulation that models the deck's card draw characteristics.

## Features

### Hero Power

The hero power may be disabled or enabled for your simulation.

### Iterations

Just playing one game with a deck is not a good representation of how the deck will perform. This is counteracted by running X number of "iterations" - that is games using your deck. The result of these iterations is then aggregated and reported on.

### Card Usage Behavior

There are three distinct ways that cards may be selected to be played during the simulation.

1. Use Big Cards First - The mode will always use big cards first.
2. Use Small Cards First - This mode will always use small cards first (includes hero power)
3. Use Random Card - A random card is selected and played from the hand.

### Shuffle Veracity

This setting allows your to control with some precision how my effort goes into shuffling the deck for each iteration. Generally a number of about 500 works well enough such that diminishing returns are apparent.

### Deck Name

This version allows you to name your deck.

### Deck

For the purposes of this curve simulation, a deck is a sequence of integers that can range from [1, 10]. A deck should not exceed 30 cards. 

For example:

Internally the program models a deck like this: `deck = new [] { 1,1,1,2,2, }`

### Saving and Loading

Saving and loading decks & simulation settings is supported.

### Deck Generation

Decks may be randomly generated by using the `File -> New` menu item.
